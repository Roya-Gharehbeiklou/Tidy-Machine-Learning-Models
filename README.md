# Tidy Machine Learning Models: Readmission and Stroke Risk Prediction

## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of predictive machine learning models for healthcare applications. The project focuses on:
1. **Predicting hospital readmission risks** within 30 days for diabetic inpatients using clinical data.
2. **Building and evaluating a stroke prediction model** using a similar machine learning workflow.

## Motivation
Hospital readmissions contribute to significant healthcare costs in the U.S., amounting to over $17 billion annually. This project leverages patient data, particularly glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, to predict readmissions. Additionally, the workflow is extended to analyze stroke prediction, showcasing the versatility of machine learning in healthcare.
